## Hi there 👋
# Hey, I’m Christine ⚡️

I’m an engineer with a multidisciplinary background in **software**, **computer**, and **electrical engineering**. I love building things that bridge hardware and software.

🛠️ **Currently exploring:**  
- Java for object-oriented design  
- Python for automation and scripting  
- C++ for system-level programming  

💡 Always learning, always building — one project at a time.
